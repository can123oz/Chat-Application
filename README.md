Basic Chat application with tracking the users and intant messsaging.

Connection with Socket.io :
Socket.IO is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server.

With this application you can chat instantly with anyone who has the link of the server and see the users who is online in the right side of the app.

Huge thanks to github.com/mozhn for helping out and tips for the application.
